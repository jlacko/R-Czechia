\usage{
vyskopis(format = "rayshaded", cropped = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{format}{Should the function return actual terrain (meters above sea level) or shaded relief (rayshaded). Allowed values are "actual" and "rayshaded".}

\item{cropped}{Should the raster provide data over Czech Republic's bounding box (cropped = FALSE) or just actual borders (cropped = TRUE). Defaults to TRUE to preserve compatiblity with earlier versions.}

\description{
Terrain of the Czech Republic as a {terra} package object.
}
\details{
The function returns a raster file of either actual terrain (values are meters above sea level) or rayshaded relief..

The raster is created from EU DEM 1.1 file by Copernicus Land Monitoring service. The original file has pixel resolution 25Ã—25 meters, which is too detailed for purposes of the package and was downsampled by factor of 4.

The extent of the raster file is bouding box of the Czech Republic; this is a change to prior versions in order to better facilitate use of the raster in natural sciences context. To preserve compatibility optional argument `cropped` has been created, defaulting to `TRUE` (i.e. behaviour before v1.10.0).

Due to package size constraints both versions are stored externally (and a working internet connection is required to use the package).

The data is current to year 2011 (but it is not expected to materially change over time). Downloaded size of the rasters is 52 MB.
