# Contributing to RCzechia

This outlines how to propose a change to `{RCzechia}`. No matter your current skills, it’s possible to contribute to the package. 

I appreciate any sort of contribution, no matter how big or small it may seem. A bug report is extremely valuable, as it points to an error that was missed in automated testing and causes a problem that needs fixing.

## Fixing typos

You can fix typos, spelling mistakes, or grammatical errors in the documentation directly using the GitHub web interface, as long as the changes are made in the _source_ file. 
This generally means you'll need to edit [roxygen2 comments](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/articles/roxygen2.html) in an `.R`, not a `.Rd` file. 
You can find the `.R` file that generates the `.Rd` by reading the comment in the first line.

## Greater changes

If you want to make a bigger change, it's a good idea to file an issue first and agree on the right approach, before comitting time and effort in a particular direction. 

## Suggest a dataset to be included

Given the focus of the package on providing relevant datasets a common issue is proposing a new spatial datset (datasets). I am open to extending the package functionality and making of the users easier; I appreciate new inspiration in both social and physical science areas.

The best approach for this is by filing a ticket on the [Issues](https://github.com/jlacko/RCzechia/issues) page. If possible with a suggestion – a link or what not – of a relevant source of the dataset to be introduced.

## Thanks for contributing!
