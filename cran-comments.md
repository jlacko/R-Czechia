## CRAN checks
The source code had been amended, to use more conservative utils::download.file instad of curl::curl_download.

As requested in comments to v1.8.6 submission the vignette (formerly static) has been replaced by a dynamic one, again tested on mac builder https://mac.r-project.org/macbuilder/results/1637871311-0df675c79c52f327/

Note that the vignette uses internet resources, 24/7 availability of which can not be 100% guaranteed by the package maintainer. Compliance at all times with the CRAN policy (graceful fail on internet resources not available) has been requested by prof. Brian D. Ripley, in a very specific wording. 

A static vignette seems the only reliable way to achieve this / as having try & catch blocks *in vignette code* is not a feasible way to introduce the package functionality to its target user base of entry level R spatial users. This is something else than having try & catch in actual package code, where it will not confuse users just starting out on the learning curve.

It is therefore expected that a static vignette will be introduced in a future version, once the reliability of the code used is re-established.
