## Resubmission
This is a resubmission; compared to previous version I have:

* fixed the package size issue - data are stored remotely (Amazon S3) and loaded from the internet
* used the proper CRAN template of MIT license
* added examples as appropriate


It is likely to be of interest mainly to Czech R users, but in local context has - hopefuly - value. It has lived for a while on GitHub and received positive feedback.

Written consent of the copyright holder for the source data was requested and given; it is available (in Czech language only) on https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jlacko/RCzechia/master/data-raw/confirmation.pdf

## Test environments
* ubuntu 16.04 (RStudio Server on AWS), R 3.4.3
* ubuntu 14.04 (Travis), R 3.4.2
* windows 10 (desktop), R 3.4.3

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs.
